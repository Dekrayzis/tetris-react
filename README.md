## Tetris built in React.js

I create this javascript game as a test of my abilities due to never creating a game before in javascript with a four week deadline.
For a game developer that is probably quite shocking to some.

## Score board
When the player is inactive on the title screen the score board is revealed. Similar in style to the old arcade machines.

## Controls:
Cursor input for movement (Left, right, down) keys).
'B' for dropping the Tetronimo.
'Z' to active 'zoning' feature.

## Leveling up
Each level progressivly becomes more challenging as the speed of the drop rate increases.

## Zoning

zoning allows for the player to rack up points by not removing a completed row until the progress meter is emptied.
More completed rows scores more points!

## Award Row clearences

Back-2-back - removing two rows at the same time.
Tetris - removing four rows at the same time.
Ocktris - removing eight rows at the same time.
Decahexatris - removing sixteen rows at once.
Perfectris - removing 18 or more rows at once.

## Music
Each stage has music that offers an 80s throw back.

## Future updates
I intend to include three.js particle effects for the background at some point to give the game a further similar appeal to Tetris effect on the playstation 4.
